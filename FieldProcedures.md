## Robotics Academy Field Procedures

Always remember to be courteous and try to use the field to the benifit of all robot groups.  Take care of the surface and the game pieces at all times.
1. Only 4 robots on field at any time and remember we have two field setups.

2. If parts fall off robot onto the field, must pick them up immediately.  This way you will know if any parts on the field are from your robot.

3. A group that is done with the field, makes sure its game ready for the next robot. i.e. Reset field after use for the next group.

4. Return all objects you've borrowed from the field when you are done with them or as groups need them for practice matches.

5. Don't walk on field with your shoes.

6. Must wear socks while on the field.

7. work out a time agreement when other teams are waiting to use the field.

8. Don't leave stuff around the field - otherwise its difficult to access the field.

9. Put a one-turn limit on autonomous runs and skills runs in the days leading up to a tournament.
