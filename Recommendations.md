## Robotics Academy Recommendations

1. More workspace / tables in the rooms as we usually run out of tables.

2. Move field away from wall in Boardroom - otherwise its too cramped in that area.

3. Add a cupboard / area for spare small parts.

4. Shorter stools, or higher tables to improve posture and better work habits.

5. Shorter stools so we can tuck our legs in under the table.

6. Move field away from wall in Boardroom - otherwise its too cramped in that area.

7. Have a Field Cleaner to take care of the cones. Can have cleaners in at specific times (3:00, 6:00) checking for lost parts. 

8. Each team should have only one table.

9. Teams can have a bigger table for cutting, etc.

10. People can have small bins to store parts that drop.  Also, bins that we can use for storing extra materials.

11. Cut lexan with as little waste as possible.

12. When returning one piece of chain attach it to another chain instead of just placing it in alone.

13. Take apart not used pieces and place them back once a week.

14. When cutting stuff, file both sides of the piece you cut.
