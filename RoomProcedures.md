## Robotics Academy Room Procedures

1. Occupy only your ONE table. Stay in your area - don't use another team's table. 

2. Don't put stuff on other team's table (even if they are not there).

3. Put tools (saws, files, etc) away after using them.

4. Keep the box of axels always in the cupboards because its difficult to find them when they are on a team's table.

5. Stools tucked in when not in use.

6. Keep walkway clear - no bags, no stools out. No loitering in walking area. 

7. No parts under the table or in walkway - clean up your garbage!

8. If someone takes your tools and loses them, they are liable for it and must replace them.

9. Add a cupboard / area for spare small parts.

10. Once a week - organize the space in / below the storage area.

11. Label cupboards with general categories.

12. Shorter stools, or higher tables to improve posture and better work habits.

13. Shorter stools so we can tuck our legs in under the table.

14. Move field away from wall in Boardroom - otherwise its too cramped in that area.

Recommendation 15. More workspace / tables in the rooms as we usually run out of tables.
