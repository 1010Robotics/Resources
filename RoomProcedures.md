## Robotics Academy Room Procedures

1. Occupy only your ONE table. Stay in your area - don't use another team's table. 

2. Don't put stuff on other team's table (even if they are not there).

3. Put tools (saws, files, etc) away after using them.

4. Keep the box of axels always in the cupboards because its difficult to find them when they are on a team's table.

5. Stools tucked in when not in use. Backpacks under the table.

6. Keep walkway clear - no bags, no stools out. Don't stand in middle of walkway. No loitering in walking area. 

7. No parts under the table or in walkway - clean up your garbage!

8. If someone takes your tools and loses them, they are liable for it and must replace them.

9. Once a week - organize the space in / below the storage area.

10. Label cupboards with general categories.

11. Pick up parts off the floor. Clean up the ground before you leave (and stack your chairs).

14. Don’t waste zip ties.

15. Maintain the info on the whiteboard (tools, etc) in the Robo Dojo, and keep it up-to-date.

16. Let Mr. Ablett know when we are down to the last few items on any part so we can order them in advance. If we wait till the last item is taken, it may be too late to get those parts for the next competition.

17. Run robot in batteries on batteries higher than 8.5V.

18. Start cleaning up 15 minutes before you leave.
