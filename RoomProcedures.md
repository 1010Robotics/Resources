Let Mr. Ablett know when we are down to the last few items on any part so we can order them in advance. If we wait till the last item is taken, it may be too late to get those parts for the next competition.

If you wish to keep a unused assembly please ask Mr. Ablett for permission, otherwise disassemble and restock the parts.
