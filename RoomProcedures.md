## Robotics Academy Room Procedures

1. Occupy only your ONE table. Stay in your area - don't use another team's table. 

2. Don't put stuff on other team's table (even if they are not there).

3. Put tools (saws, files, etc) away after using them.

4. Keep the box of axels always in the cupboards because its difficult to find them when they are on a team's table.

5. Stools tucked in when not in use.

6. Keep walkway clear - no bags, no stools out. No loitering in walking area. 

7. No parts under the table or in walkway - clean up your garbage!

8. If someone takes your tools and loses them, they are liable for it and must replace them.

9. Add a cupboard / area for spare small parts.

10. Once a week - organize the space in / below the storage area.

11. Label cupboards with general categories.

12. Shorter stools, or higher tables to improve posture and better work habits.

13. Shorter stools so we can tuck our legs in under the table.

14. Move field away from wall in Boardroom - otherwise its too cramped in that area.

15. Clean up the ground before you leave (and stack your chairs).

16. When cutting zip ties, make sure to clean up the stuff on the ground.

17. When cutting stuff, file both sides of the piece you cut.

18. Donâ€™t waste zip ties.

19. Maintain the info on the whiteboard (tools, etc) in the Robo Dojo, and keep it up-to-date.

20. Let Mr. Ablett know when we are down to the last few items on any part so we can order them in advance. If we wait till the last item is taken, it may be too late to get those parts for the next competition.
